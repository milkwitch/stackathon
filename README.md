# stackathon

This project was a hackathon-style project started during my time at Fullstack Academy.  It was built over 3 days, starting from scratch (no boilerplate/template).
The concept is to illustrate the 12 degrees of the western chromatic scale, to help users visualize the relationship between intervals and more complicated structures like scales, modes, etc.
It utilizes the Tone.js library to create/trigger the audio, and React to build the UI.
I think my shining accomplishment here was to get the sound and visuals to be linked, and setting up the configurations within Webpack and Babel to get the project running.
